# trigonometric_series
Hello. With this repository I start a large series of programs on C#, dealing with different sections of classical mathematics.

Download the program and run it. The result will be 9.105448533333616

This is the answer to the following problem:

What amount of heat is required to heat 10 kg of iron having a temperature of 20 C to 100 C 
if the heat capacity Y of the iron at a temperature of 0 C to 200 C is determined by the formula: Y = 0.1053 + 0.000142*x
